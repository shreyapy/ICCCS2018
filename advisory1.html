    <p>A very warm welcome to the International Conference on Communication and Computing Systems. ICCCS 2018 will be held at Dronacharya College of Engineering, Gurgaon. The conference proceedings (published by CRC Press – Taylor & Francis Group) and the programme include more than 500 presentations by practitioners and academicians covering a remarkable variety of topics. The conference theme consists of a range of talks and workshops designed to promote the exchange of ideas and experience relevant to practice and real-world applications. The technical programme is complemented by a social programme that is similarly varied including the conference gala dinner.</p>

    <p>We are particularly looking forward to the plenary talks. we are delighted to have such a strong and varied series of plenary talks at the conference. The underlying philosophy motivating this conference has been to bring together researchers who apply communication and computing paradigms to problems and situations that have hitherto been intractable, complex, highly nonlinear and difficult to solve. </p>

<p>Conferences like these are only possible thanks to the hard work of a great many people and the successful organization of ICCCS 2018 has required the talents, dedication and time of the organizing committee. We thank the many stream organizers for inviting, persuading and cajoling authors to present their work at the conference. We are grateful to the CRC Press – Taylor & Francis Group for their dedication and professionalism in helping us produce what is an excellent and high-quality proceedings. It only remains for us to thank all of you for participating in the conference and helping to make it a success. We hope ICCCS 2018 will live long in memory. It was our great honour and pleasure tp accept the responsibilities and challenges of Conference General Chairs. We hope that the conference will be stimulating, informative, enjoyable and fulfilling experience to all who attend it. </p>
